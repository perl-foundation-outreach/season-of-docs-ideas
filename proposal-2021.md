# PROPOSAL TITLE

## The Raku Foundation

Yet another society, doing business as *The Raku Foundation*, has
recently been constituted as "product owner" of Raku, to differentiate
it from the [Perl Foundation](https://perlfoundation.org), which is
the product owner of the Perl language and its ecosystem.

As a whole, Yet Another Society takes care of the Perl and Raku
languages and ecosystems, and has done so since its inception.

Raku, however, was started as "Perl 6" in the year 2000 and released
in Christmas 2015 as Perl 6.c. Perl 6, however, was a totally
different language designed from scratch in a community process, which
is why it eventually got its name changed to Raku in
October 2019. This spawned a process of a certain independence from
the sister language, which included the creation of a [Raku Steering
Council](https://raku.github.io/Raku-Steering-Council/), voted among
the community, and a recently released [code of
conduct](https://raku.github.io/Raku-Steering-Council/papers/CoC),
which also emerged from a community process.

The Raku Foundation thus, while inheriting the rich experience and
traditions from the Perl Foundation, will be more narrowly focused on
Raku matters, including, as is the case here, the documentation.

Yet Another Society (doing business as "The Perl Foundation") has
created, and uses in all its products, the [Artistic
License](https://opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-2.0),
designed originally for [Perl](https://perl.org), and now extended
also to Raku and most of the products in its ecosystem.

Raku has been adopted as the language of choice by quite a few
companies and individuals, including Edument, Oetiker+Partners, and
Atikon, all of them in Europe. It's used also in several academic and
research projects. Its community is relatively small (compared to its
sister language, Perl) and diverse, and mainly meets through its [IRC
channels](https://raku.org/community) and their different
repositories. All these resources are covered by the Code of Conduct,
with the intention of making them safe spaces for everyone.

Raku documentation is a volunteer effort that emerged relatively late
in the timeline of Raku development, due mainly to the fact that is's
using its own markup language, [Pod
6](https://docs.raku.org/language/pod). Unlike other markup languages
(like, for instance, the one that inspired it, [Perl
Pod](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod), it's part of the Raku language
and it's specified alongside it. That makes it specially stable, but
also makes it an integral part of the language, with the Raku compiler
itself also parsing and compiling this part of the documentation.

This language will be quite straightforward to learn for those that
already have familiarity with Perl, and being a markup language like
any other, will not be a strong hurdle to overcome for anyone who is
familiar with Markdown, AsciiDoc or any other such language.
