# PROPOSAL TITLE

## The Raku Foundation

Yet another society, doing business as *The Raku Foundation*, has
recently been constituted as "product owner" of Raku, to differentiate
it from the [Perl Foundation](https://perlfoundation.org), which is
the product owner of the Perl language and its ecosystem.

As a whole, Yet Another Society takes care of the Perl and Raku
languages and ecosystems, and has done so since its inception.

Raku, however, was started as "Perl 6" in the year 2000 and released
in Christmas 2015 as Perl 6.c. Perl 6, however, was a totally
different language designed from scratch in a community process, which
is why it eventually got its name changed to Raku in
October 2019. This spawned a process of a certain independence from
the sister language, which included the creation of a [Raku Steering
Council](https://raku.github.io/Raku-Steering-Council/), voted among
the community, and a recently released [code of
conduct](https://raku.github.io/Raku-Steering-Council/papers/CoC),
which also emerged from a community process.

The Raku Foundation thus, while inheriting the rich experience and
traditions from the Perl Foundation, will be more narrowly focused on
Raku matters, including, as is the case here, the documentation.
