Update Raku documentation to latest version
========================

Description
-----------

In November 2018, a new version of the Raku language, 6.d, was produced. This new
version introduced a few hundred new features, making some other
obsolete. There were no major grammar or functional changes, but the
language overall was made much more coherent; ambiguities were solved,
and features were uniformized.

Unfortunately, being the documentation a separate (and also volunteer)
effort, those working on it could not really keep up to date. More
than one year later, most features are already checked, but there are
still a few to go.  Additionally, new compiler versions have been produced
since then, up to an including the last one, 2021.03. Every new
version also includes changes to the language, which raises issues in
the documentation documentation of the same nature;
in general, these have not been addressed, and most new features (or
clarifications or fixes of old features) are still not part of the
documentation.

Issues that specify additions
and changes for new releases are grouped in the
[`versions`](https://github.com/Raku/doc/labels/versions) label, and
work is way behind on these. Most of them do not involve a lot of
investigation, and are purely updates; as a matter of fact, they can
be easily used for onboarding anyone that might want to help
documenting Raku.

Expected outcomes
-----------------

* Bringing documentation up to date with version latest releases,
  within the possibilities of the season of docs allotment of work.
* Address other issues that have some relationship with this issue,
  such
  as
  [2688](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2688),
  [2694](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2694)
  or [2703](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2703).

* As a bonus, the candidate might help create tools that make easier
  synchronization of documentation with
  changes, such as checking source code of Rakudo (the Raku compiler)
  and see if the the definitions of functions in the documentation are
  correct.


Required skills
---------------

Required or prefered skills the tecnical writer should have to be able to
tackle this project.

* Some experience with Raku is appreciated, but not really
  needed. Will to learn will be a requisite. The candidate will be
  expected to be able to write, run and test short programs to be used
  as examples in the documentation.
* Good, working knowledge of English.
* Good knowledge of GitHub as a collaborative working platform.

Rating
------

Medium.
