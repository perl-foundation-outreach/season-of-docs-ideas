Update Raku documentation to latest version
========================

Description
-----------

In November 2018, a new version of Raku, 6.d, was
produced. This new version introduced a few hundred new features,
making some other obsolete. There were no major grammar or functional
changes, but the language overall was made much more coherent; ambiguities were solved, and features were uniformized. 

Unfortunately, being the documentation a separate (and volunteer)
effort, those working on it could not really keep up to date. More than one year, most of features are already checked, but there are still a few to go.
Additionally, new versions have been produced since then, up to an
including the last one, 2020.02.1. Every new version also includes
changes to the documentation of the same nature; in general, these
have not been addressed, and most new features (or clarifications of
old features) are still not part of the documentation.

Taken directly from the 6.d
specification, [this issue](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2632)
was created to keep track of changes, and also to ask for
clarifications and comment on issued. Issues that specify additions
and changes for new releases are grouped in the
[`versions`](https://github.com/Raku/doc/labels/versions) label, and
work is way behind on these.

Additionally, since that new release, the name of the language has
been changed to Raku (from Perl 6), which has implied also change of
name of several features. The adaptation to the new name has been
grouped in a [milestone](https://github.com/Raku/doc/milestone/3), and
it's still ongoing. 


Expected outcomes
-----------------

* Bringing documentation up to date with version 6.d and beyond,
  within the possibilities of the season of docs allotment of work.
* Address other issues that have some relationship with this issue,
  such
  as
  [2688](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2688),
  [2694](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2694)
  or [2703](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2703).
* Create tools that make easier synchronization of documentation with
  changes, such as checking source code of Rakudo (the Raku compiler)
  and see if the the definitions of functions in the documentation are
  correct. 


Required skills
---------------

Required or prefered skills the tecnical writer should have to be able to
tackle this project.

* Some experience with Raku is appreciated, but not really
  needed. Will to learn will be a requisite. The candidate will be
  expected to be able to write, run and test short programs to be used
  as examples in the documentation.
* Good, working knowledge of English.
* Good knowledge of GitHub as a collaborative working platform.
