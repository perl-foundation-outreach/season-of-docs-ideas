Update Perl 6 documentation to 6.d
========================

Description
-----------

In November 2018, a new version of Perl 6, Perl 6.d, was
produced. This new version introduced a few hundred new features,
making some other obsolete. There were no major grammar or functional
changes, but the language overall was made much more coherent.

Unfortunately, being the documentation a separate (and volunteer)
effort, those working on it could not really keep up to date. 6 months
later, most of new features are not checked, and most new
documentation (or changes in examples) remains unwritten.

Taken directly from the 6.d
specification, [this issue](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2632)
was created to keep track of changes. 


Expected outcomes
-----------------

* Bringing documentation up to date with version 6.d
* Address other issues that have some relationship with this issue,
  such
  as
  [2688](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2688),
  [2694](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2694)
  or [2703](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2703).
* Feed back on [issue 2690](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2690),
  helping design and create tools that make easier to keep
  documentation up to date.
* If time
  allows,
  [work revision of the next release](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2673). 

Required skills
---------------

Required or prefered skills the student should have to be able to
tackle this project.

* Some experience with Perl 6 is appreciated, but not really
  needed. Will to learn will be a requisite. The candidate will be
  expected to be able to write, run and test short programs to be used
  as examples in the documentation.
* Good, working knowledge of English.
* Good knowledge of GitHub as a collaborative working platform.
