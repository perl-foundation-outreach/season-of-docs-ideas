*Big* issues in Perl 6 documentation
========================

Description
-----------

Perl 6 documentation was, from the beginning, decoupled from language
development. It was thus started much later than language itself, and
mainly done by people not involved in the programming effort
itself. This essentially resulted in a decoupling of both efforts,
with relatively wide areas of the language uncovered, or poorly
covered, by documentation.

Issues related to these areas were marked as *big*, because they
usually involved creating many new pages from scratch, or creating
tutorials for features that had not, so far, been documented.

In this case, documentation involves good skills in reading source
code that implement features, but also proactivity requesting tests or
raising issues when the implementation is incosistent, does not behave
as expected, or untested. In general, that implies that those *big*
issues require a degree of effort that las left them, in general,
unadressed for long periods of time, as much as three years in some
cases.



Expected outcomes
-----------------

*
  Document
  [`*REPO` and CUR classes](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/502). This
  is a set of classes which describe how modules are preprocessed, and
  how to work with them. It needs to be written from scratch.
  
* [Exceptions](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/516) are quite
  numerous, and
  mostly [undocumented](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/517). It
  will help if it's reorganized, a a dedicated tutorial is written
  from scratch. [Control exceptions are undocumented either](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1268)
  
*
  [The documentation on contexts](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1225) is
  quite incomplete. The discussion on the issue is quite long,
  and can be incorporated into the documentation, too.

* Traits are not well documented
  either: [here](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1957)
  and [here](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2718), as well
  as [here](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2714)
  and [here](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1730).


Required skills
---------------

Required or prefered skills the person should have to be able to
tackle this project.

* Some prior experience with Perl 6 is appreciated, but not really
  needed. Will to learn it will be a requisite. The candidate will be
  expected to be able to write, run and test short programs to be used
  as examples in the documentation.
* Good, working knowledge of English.
* Good knowledge of git and GitHub.

Rating
------

Medium.
