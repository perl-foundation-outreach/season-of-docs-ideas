*Big* issues in Perl 6 documentation
========================

Description
-----------

Perl 6 documentation was, from the beginning, decoupled from language
development. It was thus started much later than language itself, and
mainly done by people not involved in the programming effort
itself. This essentially resulted in a decoupling of both efforts,
with relatively wide areas of the language uncovered, or poorly
covered, by documentation.

Issues related to these areas were marked as *big*, because they
usually involved creating many new pages from scratch, or creating
tutorials for features that had not, so far, been documented.

In this case, documentation involves good skills in reading source
code that implement features, but also proactivity requesting tests or
raising issues when the implementation is incosistent, does not behave
as expected, or untested. In general, that implies that those *big*
issues require a degree of effort that las left them, in general,
unadressed for long periods of time, as much as three years in some
cases.



Expected outcomes
-----------------

* Bringing documentation up to date with version 6.d
* Address other issues that have some relationship with this issue,
  such
  as
  [2688](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2688),
  [2694](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2694)
  or [2703](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2703).
* Feed back on [issue 2690](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2690),
  helping design and create tools that make easier to keep
  documentation up to date.
* If time
  allows,
  [work revision of the next release](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2673). 

Required skills
---------------

Required or prefered skills the student should have to be able to
tackle this project.

* Some experience with Perl 6 is appreciated, but not really
  needed. Will to learn will be a requisite. The candidate will be
  expected to be able to write, run and test short programs to be used
  as examples in the documentation.
* Good, working knowledge of English.


Rating
------

Medium.
