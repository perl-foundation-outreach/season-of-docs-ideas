# Raku documentation: Season of Doc ideas

<img src="img/tpf_logo_transparent.png" width="300px" align="right" alt="TPF">

This is a repository with ideas
about [Raku documentation](https://docs.perl6.org) for [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/). These must be focused on a single
project, and in principle there will be a single mentor for the chosen
persons or persons.

JJ Merelo is already the main contributor
to [Raku documentation](https://github.com/Raku/doc) and has been
contributing to it for around 4 years.

The technical writer working on the documentation will be onboarded
via easy-to-solve outstanding issues in the documentation, submitted
via pull requests. There are many persons with permission to review
and merge those pull requests, so it is going to be more of a
distributed effort.

Two ideas have been proposed for this:

* [Bring documentation up-to-date with latest specs](docs.md)
* [Outstanding documentation issues](big.md).

The (WIP) proposal for this year is included in [this
document](proposal-2021) ([source](proposal-2021.md)).

## Contact

Contact JJ Merelo (jjmerelo at GMail) or use issues to propose new
ideas or express your interest in participating as a writer.
